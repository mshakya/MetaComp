#' Extracts phyloseq format otu table from merged table for given taxonomic level
#' otu here corresponds to the taxonomic level.

#' This implementation is built upon phyloseq. We recommend not to use this for strain
#' level classification as creation of taxa_table doesn't work with strain level or
#' plasmid sequences
#'
#' @param filepath merge table containig samples as columns and taxa as rows.
#' @param TAXON The taxonomic level (phylum, class, order, family, species) to create OTU table. It has to be all small letters.
